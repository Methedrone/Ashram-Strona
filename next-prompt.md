Event detail prototype: focused page to present an event with schema-ready metadata and registration CTA.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**

Use a warm, grounded aesthetic with terracotta accents and generous whitespace. Pages should:

- Use a centered header with language switcher and clear navigation.
- Hero area: large serif heading, short text, secondary CTA; use an optimized responsive image.
- Content sections: alternating background (light / white), clear H2 section headings, cards for events/teachings.
- Footer: simple link list, contact details, and small logo.

Accessibility rules:

- Color contrast >= 4.5:1 for body text.
- Images must include meaningful `alt` text.
- Interactive controls keyboard-focusable and have ARIA labels when necessary.

Page Structure:
1. Header with navigation and language switcher
2. Hero with event title, date, and prominent register CTA
3. Event details block: description, schedule, teachers/speakers, location (with inline map)
4. Registration section: ticket options, contact, and `Register` CTA
5. Related events list (cards)
6. Footer with contact and links
