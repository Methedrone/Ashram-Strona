> **Key insight:** Regular Nama Japa quiets the mind and keeps the heart steady in peace.

Nama Japa means repetition of the divine name that is highest for us. Babaji taught that Nama Japa purifies the mind and brings peace and focus.

## Om Namah Shivay

Babaji taught that the most powerful mantra for the present age is **Om Namah Shivay**. This is the primary mantra used by Babaji's devotees worldwide.

The meaning of this mantra transcends words - it is a direct connection with Divine consciousness, with the energy of Shiva that permeates the entire universe.

## Forms of Practice

Japa can take various forms:

- **Japa on mala** - repeating the mantra using a rosary (108 beads)
- **Loud chanting** - singing the mantra in a group
- **Whisper** - quiet repetition to oneself
- **Mental japa** - repetition in the mind
- **Writing the mantra** - writing the mantra as a form of meditation

## The Power of Sincerity

What matters most is not how we practice, but with what heart. Babaji emphasized that Nama Japa performed with whole heart and sincerity brings great peace and tranquility.

In today's world, Nama Japa is especially important to remain calm and centered. Regular repetition of the divine name creates an inner sanctuary to which we can always retreat.

## Nama Japa in daily practice

Nama Japa naturally complements [meditation](/en/teachings/meditation-for-beginners) and [Karma Yoga](/en/teachings/karma-yoga). At the ashram we practice it in the morning and evening, and the mantra accompanies the [Havan](/en/teachings/sacred-fire-ceremony) and [Aarti](/en/teachings/aarti-ceremony) ceremonies.

If you want to join the practice, see [upcoming events](/en/events) or reach out via [contact](/en/contact).

*Om Namah Shivay*
