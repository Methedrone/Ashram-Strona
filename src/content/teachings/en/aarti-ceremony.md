> **Key insight:** Aarti is a shared prayer of light that opens the heart and strengthens devotion.

Aarti is a daily ceremony in which participants sing and make offerings to the Divine. The literal meaning of the word Aarti is "that which removes pain."

## The Aarti Ceremony

Aarti is usually performed before an altar with photographs, statues and images of God, the Great Spirit or Goddess. For devotees of Babaji, the photographs and images usually depict Sri Babaji.

The Aarti tray contains an oil lamp made with ghee and a cotton wick. This lamp is lit and waved before the Divine images, while all present sing bhajans (devotional songs).

## Significance of the Practice

Aarti is an act of bhakti yoga - the yoga of devotion. Through song, light and offerings, we open our hearts to the Divine presence. The collective energy of the group multiplies the power of the practice.

In the Haidakhan tradition, Aarti is usually performed twice daily - morning and evening. It is a time when the entire ashram community gathers together in prayer and devotion.

## The Power of Bhajan

Singing bhajans during Aarti requires no musical training - it requires only an open heart. The vibrations of sacred songs purify the space and elevate the consciousness of all present.

Babaji loved bhajans and often sang them himself, leading his devotees in ecstatic devotion to the Divine.
