  - question: "How long should a beginner meditate?"
    answer: "Start with 10-15 minutes daily. Regularity matters more than duration — it is better to meditate briefly every day than for an hour once a week. Gradually extend the time as you feel comfortable."
  - question: "What should I do when I cannot focus during meditation?"
    answer: "This is completely normal. Do not fight your thoughts — simply observe them and gently return to the mantra or breath. Babaji taught that repeating Om Namah Shivaya is the most effective way to calm a restless mind."
  - question: "Do I have to sit in the lotus position?"
    answer: "No. The most important thing is that your spine is straight and your body comfortable. You can sit on a chair, a cushion, or even lie down if sitting causes pain. Physical comfort supports mental stillness."

> **Key insight:** Meditation is a simple daily practice that quiets the mind and opens the heart.

Meditation is the heart of spiritual practice in the Babaji tradition. It is not a mysterious ritual reserved for monks and yogis — it is a **simple, natural skill** that anyone can develop. Babaji taught that true meditation begins with quieting the mind and opening the heart.

## What is meditation

In the Haidakhan tradition, meditation does not mean complex visualization techniques or intellectual exercises. It is rather a **state of being** — a conscious pause amid the daily rush, to experience the silence that always exists beneath the surface of our thoughts.

Babaji taught three main pillars of spiritual practice: **Truth, Simplicity and Love**. Meditation is the space where these three pillars meet — we sit in the truth of the moment, with the simplicity of a mind free from expectations, and with love for the Divine presence.

## How to begin — a practical guide

You need no special equipment, experience or knowledge. Here is a simple way to start:

1. **Choose a quiet place** — a corner of a room, a cushion on the floor, a chair by the window. If possible, create a regular practice spot that your mind will associate with stillness.
2. **Sit comfortably** — spine straight, shoulders relaxed, palms on your knees. You do not need to sit in lotus — comfort is more important than a perfect posture.
3. **Close your eyes** and take a few deep breaths, allowing tension to flow out of your body.
4. **Begin repeating the mantra** Om Namah Shivaya — mentally, in a whisper, or quietly. Let the mantra become your anchor of attention.
5. **When thoughts arise** — and they will — do not fight them. Notice them and gently return to the mantra. This is the entire practice.

Start with **10 minutes daily**, ideally in the morning, right after waking up. The morning stillness is a natural ally of meditation.

## Obstacles and how to overcome them

Every beginner encounters the same challenges:

- **Restless mind** — this is normal, not a sign of failure. The mind produces thoughts just as the lungs produce breath. The practice lies in not following every thought. [The practice of Nama Japa](/en/teachings/nama-japa) is particularly helpful here.
- **Physical discomfort** — if your legs go numb or your back aches, change position. Meditation should not be suffering. Over time, the body adapts to sitting in stillness.
- **Impatience** — expecting immediate results is a trap of the ego. Babaji taught that **Karma Yoga** — selfless action — applies to meditation too. Practice without attachment to outcomes.
- **Inconsistency** — it is easier to practice daily at the same time. Make meditation part of your routine like brushing your teeth — not a luxury, but a necessity.

## Meditation in daily life

True meditation does not end when we rise from the cushion. Babaji taught that **every moment is an opportunity for practice**. Washing dishes, sweeping the floor, preparing food — any activity performed with full presence becomes meditation.

In Babaji's ashram, physical work — **Karma Yoga** — is equally as important as sitting in meditation. Service to others, carried out with love and without expectation of reward, is one of the most powerful forms of spiritual practice.
