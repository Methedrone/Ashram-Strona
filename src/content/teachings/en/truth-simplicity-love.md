> **Key insight:** Truth, Simplicity and Love are foundations that lead to unity with the Divine.

Babaji taught that the path of Truth, Simplicity and Love (Satya, Saralta, Prem) is the highest yoga in this age. These three fundamental principles form the foundation of all spiritual development.

## Truth (Satya)

Truth is not just speaking the truth, but living in accordance with reality. It is honesty with oneself and others, authenticity in every action. Truth purifies the mind and heart, allowing us to perceive the Divine nature in everything.

## Simplicity (Saralta)

Simplicity is living without unnecessary complications, free from material attachments. Babaji taught that true wealth lies in simplicity of being - in a pure heart, calm mind and readiness to serve others.

## Love (Prem)

Love is the highest force in the universe. Babaji said: "Love me more and more - as I love you without limits, as I have always loved you and always will. Never doubt my love."

These three principles, practiced together, lead to unity with the Divine and service to all humanity.

## Practice at Babaji Ashram

At Babaji Ashram these principles are embodied in daily practices like [Karma Yoga](/en/teachings/karma-yoga), [Nama Japa](/en/teachings/nama-japa), [Havan](/en/teachings/sacred-fire-ceremony), and [Aarti](/en/teachings/aarti-ceremony).
