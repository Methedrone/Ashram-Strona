> **Key insight:** Kriya Yoga steadies breath and mind, creating space for inner silence and guidance.

Kriya Yoga is an ancient meditation technique centered on breath and attention. In the Babaji tradition it supports daily sadhana, helping to clear the mind and sharpen awareness. It is not an end in itself — it is a tool that leads toward truth, simplicity and love in the heart.

## Breath as a path to stillness

In Kriya Yoga, the breath becomes a bridge between body and mind. A calm, even breath quiets thought and helps anchor attention in the present moment. This is why Kriya Yoga naturally complements [meditation](/en/teachings/meditation-for-beginners) and [Nama Japa](/en/teachings/nama-japa).

## Kriya Yoga in ashram practice

At the ashram we practice simple forms of meditation and breath-focused attention. For those who are prepared and guided by teachers, deeper techniques are available. Kriya Yoga strengthens practices like [Karma Yoga](/en/teachings/karma-yoga) and helps maintain awareness during [Aarti](/en/teachings/aarti-ceremony) and [Havan](/en/teachings/sacred-fire-ceremony).

If you want to learn more, we invite you to reach out or join an [event](/en/events). Practicing together makes it easier to enter the rhythm of breath and silence.
