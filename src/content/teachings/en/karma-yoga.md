> **Key insight:** Karma Yoga turns ordinary work into prayer and builds humility, courage, and service.

Babaji taught that Karma Yoga is the highest yoga in this age. "Work is Worship" — these words became the foundation of life in Babaji's ashrams.

## What is Karma Yoga?

Karma Yoga is selfless service to humanity. It is performing daily duties with complete dedication, without expectation of reward or recognition. Every action — from cleaning to meditation — becomes a form of prayer when performed with a pure heart.

## Work and courage

Babaji said: "Never lose courage. Because you have taken this incarnation, you must seek achievement. And to succeed, you must work hard. The world requires strength of spirit."

Those who came to Babaji were called to work hard. Laziness was seen as a burden to the world. Through work we develop strength, courage and the ability to lead others.

## Service as transformation

Through selfless service, the ego is purified. Working together with others, without distinctions of social class or religion, we experience the unity of all beings. This leads to profound spiritual transformation.

Babaji taught: "Work here together as one. There are no class distinctions or religious differences here. No differences will be accepted."

## Karma Yoga at Babaji Ashram

At Babaji Ashram we practice Karma Yoga every day — in the kitchen, garden, and in caring for the space. It naturally complements [Nama Japa](/en/teachings/nama-japa) and [meditation](/en/teachings/meditation-for-beginners). During retreats, communal work shapes the rhythm of the day alongside [Havan](/en/teachings/sacred-fire-ceremony) and [Aarti](/en/teachings/aarti-ceremony).

Want to experience this practice in daily life? See [upcoming events](/en/events) or [contact us](/en/contact) to plan a stay. If you want to support the ashram, visit [donations](/en/donations).
