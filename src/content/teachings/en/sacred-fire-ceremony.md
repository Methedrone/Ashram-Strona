Havan (or Yagna) is an ancient Vedic ceremony in which offerings are made into sacred fire accompanied by mantras. Babaji taught this practice as a powerful tool for spiritual purification.

## The Power of Sacred Fire

Fire in the Vedic tradition is seen as a medium between the physical and spiritual worlds. It is a purifying force that transforms material offerings into spiritual energy.

During Havan, we offer not only physical substances (ghee, grains, herbs), but also our negative tendencies, fears and attachments. The fire consumes everything, leaving behind a purified consciousness.

## The Havan Ceremony

A traditional Havan ceremony requires:
- Kund (specially prepared fire pit)
- Ghee (clarified butter)
- Samidha (sacred wood)
- Grains and herbs
- Mantras chanted by a priest or the entire community

In Babaji's ashrams, Havan is practiced regularly - often on Mondays or during special festivals like Navaratri.

## The Vibrations of Mantras

During the Havan ceremony, the vibrations of the mantras combine with the fire element, creating a powerful energy field. Participants sitting around the fire experience deep purification on all levels - physical, mental and spiritual.

Babaji taught that regular Havan practice helps purify the atmosphere, both outer and inner.
