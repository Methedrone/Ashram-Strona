> **Key insight:** Om Namah Shivaya is a simple, profound practice that purifies the mind and opens the heart to silence.

Om Namah Shivaya is one of the oldest and most important mantras in the spiritual tradition of India. Babaji of Haidakhan taught that it is **the supreme mantra for the present age** — the key to purifying the mind, opening the heart and connecting with Divine consciousness.

## The meaning of the five syllables

The mantra Om Namah Shivaya consists of five sacred syllables, each corresponding to one of the five elements of nature:

- **Na** — earth (prithvi) — stability and grounding
- **Mah** — water (jala) — fluidity and purification
- **Shi** — fire (agni) — transformation and inner light
- **Va** — air (vayu) — breath and freedom
- **Ya** — ether (akasha) — space and consciousness

By repeating these five syllables, we harmonize the five elements within our body and mind, restoring natural balance. The syllable **Om** added at the beginning represents the Absolute — the source and goal of all existence.

## How to practice the mantra

Practicing the Om Namah Shivaya mantra requires no special preparation or elaborate rituals. Babaji emphasized above all **simplicity and sincerity**:

- **Japa on a mala** — the traditional practice using a rosary of 108 beads. Sit comfortably, close your eyes and repeat the mantra while moving your fingers along each bead. One full rotation of the mala is one round.
- **Kirtana** — group chanting of the mantra, usually accompanied by instruments. The collective energy amplifies the power of the vibrations.
- **Silent japa** — repeating the mantra mentally during everyday activities: walking, working, waiting. The mind gradually becomes saturated with the sound of the mantra.
- **Likhit japa** — writing the mantra by hand, line after line, as a form of meditation requiring patience and focus.

The best times for practice are **brahma muhurta** (the hour before dawn) and evening, though the mantra can be repeated at any moment of day or night.

## The transformative power of the mantra

Regular practice of Om Namah Shivaya brings profound changes on many levels. On the mental level — it calms the ceaseless stream of thoughts and brings inner silence. On the emotional level — it dissolves fear, anger and attachment, replacing them with peace and joy. On the spiritual level — it gradually reveals the practitioner's true nature, hidden beneath layers of ego and conditioning.

Babaji said: **"This mantra is more powerful than all others."** This is not about a magical formula, but about a vibration that resonates with the deepest truth of our being. Each repetition is a small act of devotion — **a pranam to the Absolute that lives within each of us**.

In the [Aarti ceremony](/en/teachings/aarti-ceremony) and in the [practice of Nama Japa](/en/teachings/nama-japa), the Om Namah Shivaya mantra forms the heart of spiritual sadhana. It is also an integral part of the [sacred fire ceremony Havan](/en/teachings/sacred-fire-ceremony), where we offer the mantra together with ghee and grains to the holy fire.

Begin with one round of the mala per day. Let the mantra become your breath.

*Om Namah Shivay*
