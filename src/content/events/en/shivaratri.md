> **Key Thought:** Shivaratri is a time to overcome darkness and ignorance through the light of spiritual wisdom.

Maha Shivaratri, or "The Great Night of Shiva," is one of the most significant festivals in the Hindu tradition. In our ashram, we celebrate it according to tradition, spending the entire night in prayer and devotion.

## Program of the Celebration

The celebrations begin in the evening and last until dawn, encompassing four main cycles (pahars) of prayers:

**Schedule:**
- 18:00 - Opening and first Aarti
- 21:00 - Second puja and chanting
- 00:00 - Third puja (Mahashivaratri)
- 03:00 - Fourth puja and morning hymns
- 06:00 - Conclusion and communal breakfast

## Spiritual Significance

Shiva symbolizes the supreme consciousness. The night of Shivaratri is considered a time when spiritual energy is most accessible to seekers. Through fasting, vigil, and the repetition of the mantra *Om Namah Shivay*, we strive for inner transformation.

## Information for Participants

We welcome everyone to join. Please let us know if you are coming so we can prepare enough food for the breakfast following the fast.

*Om Namah Shivay*
