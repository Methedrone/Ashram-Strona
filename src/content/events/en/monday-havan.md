Every Monday morning at Babaji's Ashram, a traditional Havan (sacred fire) ceremony takes place. This is a regular practice that is open to all who wish to participate.

## Schedule

**Start time:** 9:00 AM
**Duration:** Approximately 1-1.5 hours
**Day:** Every Monday

## What is Havan?

Havan is an ancient Vedic ceremony in which offerings are made into sacred fire while reciting mantras. It is a powerful practice of purification - both individual and collective.

During the ceremony:
- We offer ghee, grains and sacred herbs
- We chant the mantra Om Namah Shivay
- We meditate by the fire
- We receive prasad (blessed food)

## For Visitors

No prior experience or knowledge required. Bring:
- Comfortable clothing (preferably in natural colors)
- Open mind and heart
- Optional: offerings for the fire (ghee, rice, fruits)

The ceremony is free, though donations to support the ashram are welcome.
