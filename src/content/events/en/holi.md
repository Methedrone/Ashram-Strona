> **Key Thought:** Holi is a time for forgiveness and renewal of relationships in the spirit of love.

Holi, known as the Festival of Colors, is one of the most joyful holidays in the Vedic calendar. We celebrate the arrival of spring and the triumph of Prahlad over Holika, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.

## Celebration Flow

In the ashram, we celebrate Holi in the spirit of community and joy:

- 10:00 - Morning Aarti and blessing of colors
- 11:00 - Joyful color play and chanting
- 13:00 - Festive communal lunch
- 15:00 - Satsang and sharing experiences

## Symbolism of Holi

The colors in Holi symbolize the diversity of creation and unity in God. It is a day when social differences blur, and everyone becomes equal in the joyful celebration of life.

## Practical Tips

Please wear old, light-colored clothes that you don't mind getting stained. While the dyes are washable, light fabrics may permanently change color.
