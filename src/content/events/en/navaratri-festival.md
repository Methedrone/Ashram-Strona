> **Key insight:** Navaratri is a time of intensive practice that deepens devotion and community.

Navaratri is a significant festival lasting nine nights (and ten days), during which various forms of the goddess Durga are worshiped. The word "Navaratri" comes from Sanskrit, where "Nava" means nine and "Ratri" means night.

## Festival Program

During Navaratri at Babaji's ashram:

**Morning ceremonies:**
- Havan (sacred fire ceremony) at dawn
- Bhajan singing
- Meditation and japa

**Evening ceremonies:**
- Aarti with ghee lamps
- Recitation of sacred texts
- Communal devotional singing

## Spiritual Significance

Each night of Navaratri is dedicated to a different form of the Divine Mother. It is a time of intensive spiritual practice, fasting (optional) and devotion. The festival concludes on the tenth day, known as Vijaya Dashami - the day of victory of good over evil.

## For Visitors

All are welcome to join the ceremonies. Please contact us in advance if you plan a multi-day stay during the festival.
